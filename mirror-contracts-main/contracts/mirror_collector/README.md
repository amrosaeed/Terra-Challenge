# Mirror Collector

**NOTE**: Reference documentation for this contract is available [here](https://docs.mirror.finance/contracts/collector).

The Collector accumulates fee rewards generated from CDP withdrawal within the protocol, and converts them into UST in order to purchase MIR from the MIR-UST Terraswap pool. The MIR is then sent to the Gov Contract to supply trading fee rewards for MIR stakers.
